# FortGen (Iodine)
SDK Generator for (most) Fortnite Versions
<br>
Very Incomplete and does NOT dump actual Properties
<br>
Made this out of boredom in about an hour so dont expect many updates if any at all.
<br>
Also, this works surprisingly fast (prob bc of fastcall) so it should easily be done in less than 5 seconds, even on a slow computer.

# Using
1: Build the dll in VS 2022 in Release Mode
<br>
2: Inject into Fortnite with **FAKE OR SUSPENDED Anticheats** (I'm not sure if you'll get banned if it's an older version but just in case don't take the risk and launch with Fake/Suspended ACs)
<br>
3: Press OK and go to the SDK folder in GamePath/FortniteGame/Binaries/Win64/SDK and there you go.

# Support
Should (hopefully) work on most versions between season 1 and season 15

# Disclaimer
I mostly just made this for getting FortItemEntry and while it does dump (I'm assuming) all Structs it is **NOT** Build Ready and will not work for any project unless you take the time to add other files like classes and stuff which is pointless.
